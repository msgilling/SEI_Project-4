# Overview
My final project as a Software Engineer Immersive Student at General Assembly was to create a full-stack application with a React front-end and Django back-end. It was a solo project where I made sure to focus on it being mobile responsive first.


*â€˜night dazeâ€™* is a sky themed social media app where users can upload photos of the sky to share with one another from their devices. Users can register and upload a custom profile image then upload, edit and delete their posts, comment on each other's images and view their own profile to admire their own collection.

*â€˜night dazeâ€™* was inspired by my own love for Instagram, combined with the sky and positivity. As a user, when you register and log in, you get a randomised daily affirmation before viewing the timeline.

I deployed the website using Heroku, which is a free server that sleeps when it is not in use. Please allow it a minute or two to wake up and get going! ðŸ’¤

## Approach taken
**Planning:**
Once I had decided on my project I took my time to plan each stage to ensure I covered all bases and could meet the goals of my MVP. I also knew early on I wanted it to be made mobile responsive first. With this in mind I created a wireframe to help me organise the flow of the app as well as planned the models I needed and the relationships between them.
