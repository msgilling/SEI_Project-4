# sei-project-4
<h1>Overview</h1>
My final project as a Software Engineer Immersive Student at General Assembly was to create a full-stack application with a React front-end and Django back-end. It was a solo project where I made sure to focus on it being mobile responsive first.

<i>‘night daze’</i> is a sky themed social media app where users can upload photos of the sky to share with one another from their devices. Users can register and upload a custom profile image then upload, edit and delete their posts, comment on each other's images and view their own profile to admire their own collection.

<i>‘night daze’</i> was inspired by my own love for Instagram, combined with the sky and positivity. As a user, when you register and log in, you get a randomised daily affirmation before viewing the timeline.
